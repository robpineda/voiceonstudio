## Original User Request:
App app for voice actors that analyzes uploaded audio files and crops out the unwanted samples out of their voice acting. For example, a voice actor records a 20 minute long audio file in which he reads from a script. Sometimes, he makes a mistake in one sentence (voice suddenly stopping, said the wrong word, suddenly coughed, etc), so he has to try saying that sentence again until it is perfect so he can continue reading from the script. This app should identify those perfectly spoken sentences and crop out all the mistakes, so we can be left with a single audio file with just the perfectly read script. Once it's done, the user can have the option to crop the audio, add pauses, or even add more voice to the final audio clip if he wants. At the end, he should be able to download the finalized audio file.
